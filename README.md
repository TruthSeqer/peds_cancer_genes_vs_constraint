# peds_cancer_genes_vs_constraint
Code related to data wrangling, analysis, and visualization for the manuscript "The Evolutionary Impact of Childhood Cancer on the Human Gene Pool".

The code, written in Rmarkdown, has several dependencies; 
1) R (version 4.2.2) through RStudio (version 2022.07.1) + the libraries loaded in the setup chunk of the code,
2) the metadata, compiled in a single MS Excel sheet which is published as a supplement to the paper.
3) select data sets available from the links provided in comments in the relevant chunks of this code & in the Data Availability Statements provided in the published article.

Rerunning the code will require first downloading data and code, and then rewriting code to import all the downloaded data in accordance with points 2 & 3 above. Running chuck one-by-one will alert you to missing data/paths which will require updating to you path. 

Any questions or comments may be directed to me, Ulrik Stoltze (ulrik.kristoffer.stoltze@regionh.dk), as the corresponding author of the work.
